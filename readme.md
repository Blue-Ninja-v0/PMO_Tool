***NONE OF THIS IS FINAL AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS PER YOUR RECOMENDATIONS AND GUIDELINES.***

## Current Architecture

### Backend Structure üèóÔ∏è
The backend is structured into four main components:

1. **app.py**: Main Flask application
   - Entry point for the Flask application
   - Configures database, caching, and other app settings
   - Imports and registers the API blueprint
   - Defines route handlers for serving HTML templates

2. **models.py**: Database models
   - Defines SQLAlchemy ORM models for database tables
   - Key models: Project, Task, TaskPred, TaskRsrc

3. **services.py**: Business logic and data processing
   - Contains functions for graph operations, data analysis, and formatting
   - Serves as an intermediate layer between the API and database models

4. **api.py**: API routes and handlers
   - Defines a Flask Blueprint for API routes
   - Implements route handlers for various API endpoints
   - Utilizes services from services.py for data processing
   - Implements caching for improved performance

### Frontend Structure üé®
The frontend is organized into static and template folders:

1. **static/**
   - **css/**: Contains CSS files for styling
   - **js/**: Contains JavaScript files for client-side functionality

2. **templates/**: Contains HTML templates for different views
